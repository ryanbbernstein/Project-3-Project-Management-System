# Grading

This is a group exercise.  The group should be comprised of 4 classmates.  Please see me if you are not able to form a group of 4 classmates.   Decide amongst yourselves how best to split up the deliverables of this project.  You should follow the agile approach.  First, create the product backlog, then determine amongst the team, who will perform which tasks.   Keep track of these assignments.  Half of your grade will be based on the group&#39;s performance and half will be based on the individual performance.
